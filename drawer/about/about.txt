<h2>Redeemed Thought</h2>
<p>Redeemed Thought is inspired by a blog that Brandon wanted to keep during his college years at UCSD. The idea was to write about the daily thoughts that he would have as he encountered the joys and struggles of life, from the perspective of one who has been redeemed by God through Jesus Christ.</p>

<span>"</span>&nbsp;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.<span>"</span> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ephesians 2:8-10</p>

<span>"</span>&nbsp;Trust in the Lord with all your heart<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do not lean on your own understanding.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all your ways acknowledge Him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And He will make your paths straight.<span>"</span> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Proverbs 3:5-6</p>
